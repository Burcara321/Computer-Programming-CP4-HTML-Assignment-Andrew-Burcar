<p>  As the third day of Godzilla's control over Cincinnati drags on, more strange reports are flowing in.  
     At 8:43 this morning,commuters in central downtown Cincinnati noticed a large dark mass descending from the overcast skies. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Air force
    reacted to the situation. By 9:00 air force fighter were deployed on on scene but their mission was quickly complicated as the unidentified object plumeted toward 14th Street.
	We have recived reports and amateur photgraphs of the mass unfolding, many report the alien attacker to be the spirit of the Returned Harambe the Gorilla. We have no confimation on the legitimacy 
    of these reports. </p>
<p> The The Department of Homleand Security has not confirmed or denied any of the evetns of today. Primatologist 
     Goane Janeodall has informed us the this is in fact the spirit of Harambe that has returned to libreate his hometwon of the Godzilla Threat. </p>
