<h2> <h2style="font-size: 500%;"> Harmabe has  returned to protect the world as Godzilla wreaks havoc through the city </h2>

<h3> Harambe, the 17 year old Western Lowland Gorilla was thought to be shot dead on May 28, 2016 at 4:00pm EDT in his enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens. </h3>

<h4> MIT and University of California, Berkeley physicists hypothesize Harambe's return was caused by a freak cosmic accident ripped the fabric of space time causing strange occurrences throughout the universe until the space time continuum tries to stabilize </center>  </h4>

<h5> Physicists cannot predict when the universes will realign.</h5>

<h6> Cincinnati Central News reports both Harambe's return and Godzilla's appearance are products of the ripping of the space time fabric. </h6>

    As the third day of Godzilla's control over Cincinnati drags on, more strange reports are flowing in.  

     At 8:43 this morning,commuters in central downtown Cincinnati noticed a large dark mass descending from the overcast skies. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Air force

     reacted to the situation. <br> By 9:00 air force fighter were deployed on on scene but their mission was quickly complicated as the unidentified object plummeted toward 14th Street.

     We have received reports and amateur photographs of the mass unfolding, many report the alien attacked to be the spirit of the Returned Harambe the Gorilla. We have no confirmation on the legitimacy 

     of these reports. </p>
